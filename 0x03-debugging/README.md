##0x03. C - Debugging

[0-main.c](./0-main.c) - program to test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

[1-main.c](./1-main.c) - Debug main.c code by Commenting out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

[2-largest_number.c](./2-largest_number.c) - Fixed the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

[3-print_remaining_days.c](./3-print_remaining_days.c) - Fixed the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
